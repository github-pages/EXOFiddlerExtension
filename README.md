## Download
<a href="https://github.com/jprknight/exofiddlerextension/releases/latest" target="_blank">Download the latest release</a> of the Exchange Online Fiddler Extension.

## Current Release Information
Version 1.0.63 addresses performance concerns when running in 'live trace' mode. Minimal features in the extension now run in this mode. Load a SAZ archive into Fiddler to see all functionality.

## Extension Purpose
The Exchange Online Fiddler Extension is an Outlook / Office 365 / Exchange / Exchange Online centric parser for Fiddler traces captured while reproducing issues to aid troubleshooting. It can be used with Outlook or other Office 365 applications, since Fiddler can decrypt HTTPS traffic and record the session data for review and troubleshooting.

The extension to alters the standard Fiddler UI:

* Colourisation of sessions.
* Add column 'Elapsed Time'.
* Add column 'Response Server'.
* Add column 'Session Type'.
* Add column 'Host IP'.
* Add column 'Authentication'.
* Add an 'Exchange Online' response inspector tab.
* Add an 'Exchange Online' menu to turn off/on extension and extension features.
